# EtchASketch

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

I was unable to complete this project without referencing other students' solutions, and even then, unable to generate a new value for each mouseover event.
For example, you can generate a random color, but you will paint with that one rando color - the individual grid cells will not be new colors.
For this same reason I was unable to create the fader option.

There is some skeleton text in the files that show these options.
